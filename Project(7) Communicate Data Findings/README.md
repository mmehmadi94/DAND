# Communicate-Data-Findings


This project is divided into two major parts.

### First Part
I will conduct an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of your choosing. I will use Python data science and data visualization libraries to explore the dataset’s variables and understand the data’s structure, oddities, patterns and relationships. The analysis in this part should be structured, going from simple univariate relationships up through multivariate relationships. In this part, I'll ask questions of the data and make my own discoveries. 

### Second Part
I will take my main findings from exploration stage and convey them to others through an explanatory analysis. To this end, I will create a slide deck that leverages polished, explanatory visualizations to communicate my results.

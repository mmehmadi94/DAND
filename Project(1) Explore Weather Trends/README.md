# Explore-Weather-Trends

In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

My goal is creating a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in my city. To do this, I follow the steps below:

1- Extract the data from the database. (SQL queries file)

- SQL query to extract the city level data then export to CSV.
- SQL query to extract the global data then export to CSV.

2- Open up the CSV (Temp data file)

3- Create a line chart that compares my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. 
(plotting the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines)

4- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages (Explore Weather Trends.pdf)

- Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
- “How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
- What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?

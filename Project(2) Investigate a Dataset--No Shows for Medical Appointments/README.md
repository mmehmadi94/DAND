# Investigate a Dataset - No-Shows for Medical Appointments


Introduction
In this project, I'll analyze data that collected from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. The dataset comes with additional information to each appointment such as:

- ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
- ‘No-show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

The original dataset has been sourced from Kaggle Dataset: Medical Appoiment No Shows on 29th October 2018
